In this tutorial, you'll learn how to download the Station extension and import or create a new wallet. If you were using a previous version of Station, follow the [Upgrade guide](upgrade.mdx) to upgrade your wallets to the latest version. 

## Download Station

Download Station by following the steps below or by visiting [https://station.money/download](https://station.money/download). 

1. [Download Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) or open your existing Chrome browser and visit the [Station page in the Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp). 

2. Click **Add to Chrome** and follow the directions in your browser. It's a good idea to [pin Station](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11190170?hl=en&sjid=14540060193646765368-NA) in the Extension toolbar so it stays accessible. 

3. When you open Station for the first time, you'll be asked to create a password. This password secures all of the accounts in your wallet, so make sure it is a secure password that you will remember!

<Admonition type="danger" icon="🔐" title="Password security">

Make sure your password is secure and memorable. In general, it's good to use a mix of numbers, special characters, and upper and lowercase letters in your password. Longer passwords are generally more secure. 

You can only [change your password](./settings/change-password.mdx) if you have access to your existing password. If you lose your password, the only way to access your accounts will be to re-install the browser extension and re-import their recovery phrases or keys.

## Create a new wallet

If this is your first time using Station, you'll need to create a new wallet. If you already have a wallet, you can [import an existing one](#import-an-existing-wallet). 

1. Open the Station extension in your browser, and then click **Create new wallet**.

    alt="Create"
/>

2. Enter a name for your new wallet. 

<img
    className="readme-img-sm"
    src="/img/screens/create/create-2.png"
    alt="Create"
/>

3. Using a pen and paper, write down your 24-word recovery phrase exactly as it appears. Number each word to make verifying easier.

Anyone who gains access to your seed phrase can access the contents of your wallet. There is no recourse for a stolen recovery phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips.

- Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
- Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
- Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe where only you can access it. 
- Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

4. Verify the written seed phrase to ensure every word is spelled correctly and that each word is in the correct order. Verifying the words in reverse order may help. 

5. Check the box to confirm that your seed phrase has been written down and click **Create Wallet**. Keep your seed phrase around for the next step. 

6. Confirm your seed phrase by selecting the correct words in each prompt and then click **Confirm**.

7. Click **Done**

8. Congratulations, you've just created a new Station wallet!

2. You can either import a wallet using a recovery phrase or from an exported key. 

3. If you are importing a wallet using a recovery phrase, enter a name for your wallet and input your wallet's recovery phrase.

    src="/img/screens/import/import-2.png"

4. If you are importing a wallet using an exported seed key, enter a name for your wallet and input your wallet's key and the password associated with the exported wallet.
