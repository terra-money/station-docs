# Stake

You can stake your assets in Station to earn staking rewards. Follow the steps below to learn how to stake. For more information on staking, visit the [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/learn/protocol#staking). 

1. Visit [https://dashboard.station.money/](https://dashboard.station.money/) in your browser and connect your Station wallet extension. 

2. In the menu on the left, click **Stake**. 

3. On the Staking page, you'll see a list of assets. The stakeable assets that you own will have a blue **Stake** button next to them. To stake an asset, select the asset by clicking the **Stake** button next to the asset you want to stake.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="💰" title="undelegating periods">

When you stake your assets, you are locking them up in exchange for rewards. Staked assets cannot be traded freely. While you still own the assets you stake, you will not be able to trade them freely until you udelegate them and wait for the undelegating period to end. Terra's undelegating period is 21 days, meaning you will have to wait 21 days to receive your Luna after undelegating it. The unstaking period varies depending on the chain the asset is staked to. 

You can [redelegate](#redelegate) a staked asset to another validator without having to wait for the unstaking period. 

For more information on staking, visit the [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/learn/protocol#staking).

## Auto stake

Not sure which validator you'd like to stake with? Auto-staking solves that problem by randomly selecting a validator that charges less than 5% commission and is not in the top 30% by voting power in order to improve decentralization. To auto-stake you can follow the steps below

1. Click **Auto-stake**. 


<img

    />

2. Enter the amount you would like to stake. Remember, once an asset is staked, you will need to wait until the end of the unstaking period before you can claim it. Click **Confirm**.
